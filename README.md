Processing repository for:
1) Processing hydrographic profiles from along-transect CTD stations
2) Creating synthetic transect lines and "sections" that are conducive to 2D interpolation
3) Produce intermediate data products that can be passed into the `DIVAnd` algorithm that yields interpolated section plots of defined hydrographic variables (e.g. $\sigma_T$)
